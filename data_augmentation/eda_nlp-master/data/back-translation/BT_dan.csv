"Right now, I just woke up after a nap. It's a little strange, but ever since I moved to Texas, I've had trouble concentrating on things. I remember starting tenth grade as soon as the clock struck four and didn't stop until it was done. Of course it was easier, but I still did it. But when I moved here, the lessons got a little more challenging, and there was a lot more work to be done, so I decided not to spend hours on it and just move on."
